If you have any AMD setup (e.g. RequireJS or Almond), Abrest will use that. Otherwise, Abrest will just attach itself to the `this` variable (which is usually going to be `window`).\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nTo install Abrest for your client side, you can run `bower install abrest` and to install it for your server-side (assuming you're using Node.JS) you can run `npm install abrest`\r\n\r\n## API\r\n```javascript\r\n// Creates an instance of Abrest in the variable 'user' and sets '/api' is the\r\n// base URL. In addition, {id: 5379} will be set as the default data that will\r\n// always be sent unless it is overriden. Also, {'user-agent': 'abrest'} is set\r\n// as the default header that will be sent unless it is overriden.\r\nvar user = new Abrest('/api/', {id: 5379}, {'user-agent': 'abrest'})\r\n\r\n// Sends a GET request from the 'user' instance of Abrest. The URL that it will\r\n// get is '/api/name' (because '/api/' is the base URL for the 'user' instance)\r\n// and all of the default headers will be sent, none of which will be overriden\r\nuser.get('name', function (error, result) {\r\n    if (error) {\r\n        throw error\r\n    }\r\n    else {\r\n        // result (should) be the user's name\r\n    }\r\n})\r\n\r\n// Sends a POST request from the 'user' instance of Abrest. The URL that it\r\n// will get is '/api/favorite_color' and the data that it will send will be\r\n// a combination of the default data and {foo: 'bar'}. Also, because there\r\n// aren't any headers here, the default ones will be used.\r\nuser.delete('favorite_color', {foo: 'bar'}, function (error, result) {\r\n    if (error) {\r\n        throw error\r\n    }\r\n    else {\r\n        // restult (should) be the user's favorite color\r\n    }\r\n})\r\n// And also Abrest (should) support POST and PUT\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Advanced Options\r\nWhen you create an instance of Abrest, you can modify some of that instance's properties. Here's an example:\r\n```javascript\r\nvar user = new Abrest() // Creates a new instance of Abrest\r\n\r\n// Sets the request timeout to 0, which means that it will never timeout.\r\n// The default timeout is 1000 (which is 1 second).\r\nuser.timeout = 0\r\n\r\n// Sets the default headers to {foo: 'bar'}. So, if a request is sent without\r\n// any headers, then Abrest will still send the header 'foo: bar'. In order to\r\n// override this header, one must send a request with a header that\r\n// specifically sets 'foo' to something else.\r\nuser.defaultHeaders = {foo: 'bar'}\r\n\r\n// Sets the default data to {foo: 'bar'}. So, if a request is sent without\r\n// any data, then Abrest will still send the data 'foo=bar'. In order to\r\n// override this data, one must send a request with a data that specifically\r\n// sets 'foo' to something else.\r\nuser.defaultData = {foo: 'bar'}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Side Note for Client-Side\r\nIn the client-side, it's almost always good to set the `content-type` header to `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.\r\nSo that's what Abrest does.\r\n\r\nIf you don't want that header to be sent, all you have to do is override it by giving a new default `content-type` header or by giving a new header in the actual request.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
